# XLR-Raiders

## Overview
XLR-Raiders is a high speed Unreal Engine multiplayer shooter developed at Georgia Tech during Spring 2024 for LMC4710. You play as an XLR-Raider, a race of military grade Android killing machines, which led to the destruction of the world as we know it. I mean, anime girls were going to be the downfall of modern civilization anyways, right? With motors implanted in their hearts, high velocity combat is the only way they can feel emotion before the sun explodes. The last piece of scum in this eerily pristine dystopian future is you. So wipe each other out.

AN IMPORTANT NOTE: Making a multiplayer shooter in Unreal Engine from the ground up in one semester turns out to be pretty hard! As such, this is a far cry from the game we envisioned in our heads, but even so, we're happy we managed to develop our skills and make some genuinely awesome things.
